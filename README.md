# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project we will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

# Dependency
This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see the uWebSocketIO Starter Guide page in the classroom within the EKF Project lesson for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF


Here is the main protocol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.

**INPUT**: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


**OUTPUT**: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x

["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y

["rmse_x"]

["rmse_y"]

["rmse_vx"]

["rmse_vy"]

### Project Introduction
In this projet we are going to implement an extended Kalman filter in C++ using simulated lidar and radar measurements detecting a bicycle that travels around our vehicle.

Lidar measurements are red circles, radar measurements are blue circles with an arrow pointing in the direction of the observed angle, and estimation markers are green triangles. The video below shows what the simulator looks like when a c++ script is using its Kalman filter to track the object. The simulator provides the script the measured data (either lidar or radar), and the script feeds back the measured estimation marker, and RMSE values from its Kalman filter.

### Explanation of the Data File
The github repo contains one data file:

obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt
Here is a screenshot of the first data file:

[...]

The simulator will be using this data file, and feed main.cpp values from it one line at a time.

Each row represents a sensor measurement where the first column tells you if the measurement comes from radar (R) or lidar (L).

For a row containing radar data, the columns are: sensor_type, rho_measured, phi_measured, rhodot_measured, timestamp, x_groundtruth, y_groundtruth, vx_groundtruth, vy_groundtruth, yaw_groundtruth, yawrate_groundtruth.

For a row containing lidar data, the columns are: sensor_type, x_measured, y_measured, timestamp, x_groundtruth, y_groundtruth, vx_groundtruth, vy_groundtruth, yaw_groundtruth, yawrate_groundtruth.

Whereas radar has three measurements (rho, phi, rhodot), lidar has two measurements (x, y).

We will use the measurement values and timestamp in your Kalman filter algorithm. Groundtruth, which represents the actual path the bicycle took, is for calculating root mean squared error.


### Reading in the Data
The code to read in and parse the data files is in the main.cpp file. The main.cpp file creates instances of a MeasurementPackage.

The code reads in the data file line by line. The measurement data for each line gets pushed onto a measurement_pack_list. The ground truth [px, py, vx, vy] for each line in the data file gets pushed onto ground_truth so RMSE can be calculated later from tools.cpp.

### Overview of a Kalman Filter: Initialize, Predict, Update
The three main steps for programming a Kalman filter:

- initializing Kalman filter variables
- predicting where our object is going to be after a time step Î”t
- updating where our object is based on sensor measurements

To measure how well our Kalman filter performs, we will then calculate root mean squared error comparing the Kalman filter results with the provided ground truth.


##### Files in the Github src Folder
The source files are in the src folder of the github repository.

- `main.cpp` - communicates with the simulator receiving data measurements, calls a function to run the Kalman filter, calls a function to calculate RMSE
- `FusionEKF.cpp` - initializes the filter, calls the predict function, calls the update function
- `kalman_filter.cpp` - defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar
- `tools.cpp`- function to calculate RMSE and the Jacobian matrix


##### How the Files Relate to Each Other
Here is a brief overview of what happens when you run the code files:

- `main.cpp` reads in the data and sends a sensor measurement to `FusionEKF.cpp`
- `FusionEKF.cpp` takes the sensor data and initializes variables and updates variables. The Kalman filter equations are not in this file. FusionEKF.cpp has a variable called ekf_, which is an instance of a KalmanFilter class. The ekf_ will hold the matrix and vector values. You will also use the ekf_ instance to call the predict and update equations.
- The KalmanFilter class is defined in `kalman_filter.cpp` and `kalman_filter.h`. You will only need to modify `kalman_filter.cpp`, which contains functions for the prediction and update steps.

### Main.cpp
The Term 2 simulator is a client, and the c++ program software is a web server.

We already discussed how main.cpp reads in the sensor data. Recall that main.cpp reads in the sensor data line by line from the client and stores the data into a measurement object that it passes to the Kalman filter for processing. Also a ground truth list and an estimation list are used for tracking RMSE.


All the main code loops in h.onMessage(), to have access to intial variables that we created at the beginning of main(), we pass pointers as arguments into the header of h.onMessage().


The code is:

creating an instance of the FusionEKF class
Receiving the measurement data calling the ProcessMeasurement() function. ProcessMeasurement() is responsible for the initialization of the Kalman filter as well as calling the prediction and update steps of the Kalman filter. You will be implementing the ProcessMeasurement() function in FusionEKF.cpp:
Finally,

The rest of main.cpp will output the following results to the simulator:

- estimation position
- calculated RMSE


### Ideas for improvement
There are ways that we can make the algorithm more efficient:

- Dealing with the first frame, in particular, offers opportunities for improvement.
- Experiment and see how low your RMSE can go!
- Try removing radar or lidar data from the filter. Observe how estimations change when running against a single sensor type!
